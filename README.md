Description: This research aimed to assess how UAV fine-scale remote sensing could contribute to monitoring and mapping AGB in Kalahari savanna ecosystems with large proportions of non-palatable herbaceous plants. The research focuses on assessing the predictive capacity of RGB and multispectral datasets in estimating aboveground biomass in a Kalahari savanna ecosystem in Botswana. Structure from Motion (SfM) photogrammetry was performed on RGB images to generate canopy height data, while multispectral data was utilised to capture spectral reflectance information. We did destructive harvesting on harvest plots to establish the allometric relationship between biomass and UAV derived canopy height and spectral reflectance. The following research questions were addressed: 
#1 How well can aboveground biomass in Kalahari savanna ecosystems be predicted by fine-scale UAV observations of canopy height and spectral reflectance?; 
#2 How well can AGB of foraging importance be predicted by fine-scale UAV observations of canopy height and spectral reflectance?; 
#3 Do these relationships between biomass components and remotely sensed attributes differ across different levels of grazing intensity?

The following scripts were used for this study.

1). Function for extracting GCP metadata- T
2). Harvest plot metadata extraction
3). Biomass_Summary
4). Lidr
